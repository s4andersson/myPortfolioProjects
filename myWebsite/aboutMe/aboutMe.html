                <h2>Who Am I</h2>
                <p class="whoAmI">
                    I’m a Swedish man born in 1992 and raised in a small town in the forests of Värmland. 
                    My passions include physical training, gaming, 
                    and programming—fields that challenge me to think creatively and solve problems.
                </p>
                <p class="whoAmI">
                    My career has taken me on a unique journey. 
                    I started as a welder and steel construction worker, 
                    traveling as an entrepreneur for hire. Seeking a change, 
                    I transitioned to personal training and massage, 
                    and became certified in the field. However, 
                    I soon realized it wasn’t the right fit for me.
                </p>
                <p class="whoAmI">
                    Today, I’m pursuing a <i>Master of Science in Computer Engineering</i> 
                    at the University of Karlstad. 
                    Programming has become a true passion, 
                    combining my love for problem-solving and continuous learning. 
                    I’m excited about the future and the opportunities this field brings.
